RMIT Uni Assignment
/* notes from fush */
Game workflow is as follows:
1. pick a game
2. predict a winner
3. run the game

Notes:
The prediction is reset after the game is run because the workflow doesnt permit the condition that the prediction is reset if the game is rerun
Instead, it will be reset after every run so that there is no prediction when it is chosen again
